 ##MovieRecommendation using machine learning
 The system will generate 10 similar movie recommendations based on cosine similarity.
 The movie recommendation system was trained using a dataset of movie titles. The dataset was pre-processed to remove any duplicates or irrelevant entries.
 The recommendation system uses the `TfidfVectorizer` from scikit-learn to convert movie titles into TF-IDF vectors. Cosine similarity is then calculated to measure 
       the similarity between user input and the movie titles in the dataset.
